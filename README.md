Copyright (C) 1998-2017 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

This is GNU Mailman, a mailing list management system distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or later.  The name of
this software is spelled "Mailman" with a leading capital 'M' but with a lower
case second 'm'.  Any other spelling is incorrect.

Technically speaking, you are reading the documentation for Mailman Core.  The
full `Mailman 3 suite <http://docs.mailman3.org>`_ includes a web user
interface called Postorius, a web archiver called HyperKitty, and a few other
components.  If you're looking for instructions on installing the full suite,
read that documentation.

Mailman is written in Python which is available for all platforms that Mailman
is supported on, including GNU/Linux and most other Unix-like operating
systems (e.g. Solaris, \*BSD, MacOSX, etc.).  Mailman is not supported on
Windows, although web and mail clients on any platform should be able to
interact with Mailman just fine.

The Mailman home page is:

    http://www.list.org

and there is a community driven wiki at

    http://wiki.list.org

For more information on Mailman, see the above web sites, or the
documentation provided with this software.
